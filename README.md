# MSc Dissertation - Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning and Statistical Models for Stock Market Prediction

## Overview
This study investigates the performance of traditional models like ARIMA and GARCH, deep learning models such as LSTM, and hybrid approaches combining statistical and machine learning methods. The findings indicate that hybrid models leveraging LSTM and GARCH provide the highest accuracy for stock market prediction by capturing both linear and non-linear dependencies
